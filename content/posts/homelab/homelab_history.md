# homelab history 

## in the beginning 

I'm going to draw a semi-arbitrary line to demarcate the beginning of my homelab.  It's really a continuation of my long practice of "tinkering with computers", but I suppose it's more specific than that.  For me, it's a place to practice, test, and explore technology in support of my software engineering career.  Sometimes AV and home projects will sneak in there, but the lab itself is to learn and practice for work.

The earliest version is probably the 2011 Mac Mini and the Drobo.  

Then when I upgraded my gaming PC, I put Ubuntu Server on the old one, and chucked a bunch of drives in it.  I was working with an Ubuntu derivative at work after many years of Red Hat and CentOS, and our primary storage tech for my project was ZFS.  So Ubuntu Server and ZoL, acting as a fileserver, running docker containers and libvirt for VMs.
